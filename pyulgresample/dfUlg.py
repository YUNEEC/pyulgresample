        Factory method to create a dfulgBase object

        By default, the merge-method uses linear interpolation for resampling.
        Dataframe (df) is a pandas-dataframe with index equal to the merged timestamps. Each column represents a message-field.
        For instance, the thrust-field of the message vehicle_local_position_setpoint message would be named as follow:
            T_vehicle_local_position_setpoint_0__F_thrust_x

            T_vehicle_local_position_setpoint_0__F_x_0
        if the field x is an array, where the 0 represents the index of the array.
        The T stands for topic, which indicates the beginning of the topic. In this example, the topcic name is vehicle_local_position_setpoint.
        The topic name is followed by a number, which indicates the topic instance. If there is only one instance of a specific topic, then this number will be 0.
        The instance number is followed by two underlines and a capital letter F, which stands for field. In the example above, the field in question is x.
