        Dataframe (df) is a pandas-dataframe with index equal to the merged timestamps. Each column represents a message-field.
        For instance, the thrust-field of the message vehicle_local_position_setpoint message would be named as follow:
            T_vehicle_local_position_setpoint_0__F_thrust_x

        The T stands for topic, which indicates the beginning of the topic. In this example, the topcic name is vehicle_local_position_setpoint.
        The topic name is followed by a number, which indicates the topic instance. If there is only one instance of a specific topic, then this number will be 0.
